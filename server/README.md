# JobHunt Server

The server for JobHunt.

## Setup Guide

**Step 1:** Install the deps:

```
$ npm install
```

**Step 2:** Make your `.env` file by copying `.env.example` and renamed it.

```
$ cp .env.example .env
```

**Step 3:** Config the appropriate value for the newly-created `.env` config file.

## Start Server

If you want to start server once:

```
$ npm start
```

If you're in development mode, and want server to self-restart every time you change the code (make sure to save the code), use this:

```
$ npm run watch
```
